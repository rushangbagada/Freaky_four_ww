# API Endpoint Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
1. **Unexpected Token Error**: The application was receiving HTML instead of JSON, typically caused by incorrect API endpoints
2. **405 Method Not Allowed**: POST requests were failing because the frontend was making requests to relative URLs that don't exist on the deployed frontend

## Root Cause
The application was making direct API calls to relative URLs (e.g., `/api/auth/login`) which work in development due to Vite's proxy configuration, but fail in production because the frontend is deployed separately from the backend.

## Solution Implemented
Created a centralized API configuration system that dynamically constructs the full API URLs based on environment variables.

### 1. API Configuration (`src/config/api.js`)
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_APP_API_URL || 'https://freaky-four.onrender.com';

export const getApiUrl = (endpoint) => {
  const cleanEndpoint = endpoint.startsWith('/') ? endpoint.slice(1) : endpoint;
  return `${API_BASE_URL}/${cleanEndpoint}`;
};

export const API_ENDPOINTS = {
  LOGIN: '/api/auth/login',
  REGISTER: '/api/auth/register',
  ME: '/api/auth/me',
  VERIFY_OTP: '/api/auth/verify-otp',
  RESET_PASSWORD: '/api/auth/reset-password',
  // ... other endpoints
};
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
- **.env**: Development configuration pointing to production API
- **.env.production**: Production environment variables
- **vite.config.js**: Updated with proper proxy configuration for development

### 3. Files Updated
The following files were updated to use the centralized API configuration:

#### Authentication & User Management
- `components/login.jsx`
- `components/register.jsx`
- `components/OTPVerification.jsx`
- `components/ResetPassword.jsx`
- `src/AuthContext.jsx`

#### Content & Data Components
- `components/home.jsx`
- `components/livesports.jsx`
- `components/newsfeed.jsx`
- `components/funfacts.jsx`
- `components/quiz.jsx`
- `components/reviews.jsx`
- `components/turf.jsx`

#### Pattern Applied
Before:
```javascript
fetch('/api/auth/login', { ... })
```

After:
```javascript
import { getApiUrl, API_ENDPOINTS } from '../src/config/api';
fetch(getApiUrl(API_ENDPOINTS.LOGIN), { ... })
```

### 4. Build Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.js` to properly handle environment variables during build
- Ensured development proxy continues to work for local development
- Production builds now use the correct API URLs

## Testing
1. **Build Success**: `npm run build` completes without errors
2. **Development Server**: `npm run dev` starts successfully
3. **API Endpoints**: All API calls now use proper full URLs in production

## Environment Variables Required
```env
VITE_APP_API_URL=https://freaky-four.onrender.com
```

## Verification Steps
1. Check browser console for API errors
2. Verify network requests are going to the correct full URLs
3. Test authentication flow (login/register)
4. Test data loading (home page, live sports, etc.)

## Benefits
1. **Environment Flexibility**: Easy to switch between different API environments
2. **Centralized Configuration**: All API endpoints managed in one place
3. **Development/Production Parity**: Same code works in both environments
4. **Error Prevention**: No more hardcoded relative URLs

## Additional Fixes
- Updated Vercel deployment configuration in `vercel.json`
- Ensured proper SPA routing with catch-all route
- Optimized build configuration for better performance

## Next Steps
1. Test all application features to ensure functionality
2. Monitor production deployment for any remaining issues
3. Consider implementing error boundaries for better error handling
4. Add API response caching for improved performance
