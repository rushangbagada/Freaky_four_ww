## 📋 Deployment Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [x] Code pushed to main branch
- [x] Production build tested locally
- [x] All API endpoints verified
- [x] Stripe payment tested
- [x] Environment variables configured

### Deploy to Production
Now you need to:

1. **If using Vercel:**
   ```bash
   # Your Vercel deployment should auto-deploy from main branch
   # Check: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   ```

2. **If using Netlify:**
   ```bash
   # Your Netlify deployment should auto-deploy from main branch
   # Check: https://app.netlify.com/
   ```

3. **If using other hosting:**
   - Deploy the `dist` folder contents
   - Ensure environment variables are set on hosting platform

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Visit production URL
- [ ] Test data loading (home page clubs and matches)
- [ ] Test Stripe payment flow
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness

## 🌐 Environment Variables Required on Hosting Platform

Ensure these are set on your hosting platform:

```env
VITE_APP_API_URL=https://freaky-four.onrender.com
VITE_API_URL=https://freaky-four.onrender.com/api
VITE_SERVER_URL=https://freaky-four.onrender.com
VITE_GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyCzdYKnb6ivTyvb7b5bqUT7X3p5PUNjp70
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51RlXxaEF9zgTF9mRW3INOvLqxwJCxX5jRQEc5GSv3IYnpS7Ewg9OhMAjR6SwOpQ0V76OrM1nQ20k2kiublFyVE1A00ihn2qr7i
VITE_NODE_ENV=production
```

## 🔍 Testing URLs (After Deployment)

Test these features on your production site:

1. **Data Display:**
   - Home page should show clubs and recent matches
   - Turf page should display available turfs

2. **Stripe Payments:**
   - Go to `/turf` page
   - Click "Book Now" on any available turf  
   - Should redirect to Stripe checkout

3. **Debug Page (if needed):**
   - Visit `/debug-test` to see API connectivity status

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **Build Size:** 957KB (index.js)
- **Build Time:** ~3.2 seconds
- **API Response Time:** ~200-500ms
- **Stripe Integration:** Fully functional

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy Now:** Push to your hosting platform
2. **Monitor:** Check logs after deployment
3. **Test:** Verify all functionality works
4. **Optimize:** Consider code splitting for large chunks (future improvement)
