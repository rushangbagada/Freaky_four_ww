# GamePage Enhancements - Live Matches Priority & Prediction Scoring System

## üéØ Overview
Enhanced the GamePage component to prioritize live matches and implemented a comprehensive prediction scoring system with one-time predictions and point evaluation.

## üöÄ Key Improvements

### 1. **Live Matches Priority System**
- **Fixed match fetching**: Now fetches from multiple endpoints to get comprehensive data
- **Status-based filtering**: Separates live/ongoing matches from other matches
- **Priority sorting**: Ongoing matches appear first, followed by live matches
- **Enhanced status handling**: Supports `ongoing`, `live`, `scheduled`, `completed`, and `finished` statuses

### 2. **One-Time Prediction System**
- **Single prediction per match**: Users can only predict once per match
- **Validation**: Prevents submissions after matches are finished
- **Clear feedback**: Shows existing predictions and prevents duplicate submissions
- **User-friendly alerts**: Clear messaging for various validation scenarios

### 3. **Comprehensive Scoring System**
- **5 Points**: Exact score match (e.g., predicted 2-1, actual 2-1)
- **3 Points**: Correct result + correct goal difference (e.g., predicted 3-1, actual 2-0)
- **1 Point**: Correct result only (e.g., predicted home win, actual home win)
- **0 Points**: Incorrect prediction

### 4. **Enhanced UI/UX**
- **Status indicators**: Visual badges for ONGOING, LIVE, SCHEDULED, FINISHED
- **Live scores**: Real-time score display for ongoing/live matches
- **Match events**: Display match events for live/ongoing games
- **Improved styling**: Better visual hierarchy and animations

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Match Data Fetching
```javascript
// Fetches from multiple endpoints for comprehensive data
const endpoints = [
  { name: 'Admin Matches', endpoint: API_ENDPOINTS.ADMIN_MATCHES },
  { name: 'Admin Live Matches', endpoint: API_ENDPOINTS.ADMIN_LIVE_MATCHES },
  { name: 'Live Matches', endpoint: API_ENDPOINTS.LIVE_MATCHES },
  // ... more endpoints
];
```

### Prediction Scoring Logic
```javascript
// Points calculation based on accuracy
if (pred1 === act1 && pred2 === act2) return 5;        // Exact match
if (predResult === actResult && predDiff === actDiff) return 3;  // Result + difference
if (predResult === actResult) return 1;                // Result only
return 0;                                               // Incorrect
```

### Status Priority System
```javascript
// Live matches get priority
const liveMatches = uniqueMatches.filter(match => 
  match.status === 'ongoing' || match.status === 'live'
);

// Sort by priority (ongoing first, then live)
liveMatches.sort((a, b) => {
  const statusPriority = { 'ongoing': 2, 'live': 1 };
  return (statusPriority[b.status] || 0) - (statusPriority[a.status] || 0);
});
```

## üé® Visual Enhancements

5. When match finishes, points are calculated and displayed

### For Completed Matches:
1. Final scores are shown
2. User's prediction (if made) is displayed
3. Points earned are calculated and shown

## üõ°Ô∏è Validation & Security

### Prediction Validation
